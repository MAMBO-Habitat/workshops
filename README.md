# MAMBO WP4 - workshops

This repository holds workshop material that covers machine learning methods for analysing drone images in complement with other data sources.

## Contents 

Current contents:

* Preparing data for training - [try on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Jw6aOe1ulKMfaSIUqwGEbnCwyzUSM9lv?usp=sharing)
* Training a model and assessing its quality [try on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FZEvjp5--BEk2Gmr29rnyDK5VmPgQslM?usp=sharing)
* Using the model to make predictions about where shrubs are [try on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PEJNda63960oLgcxx07EPQIpweB3bYmI?usp=sharing)

We [supply data](https://github.com/MAMBO-Habitat/metadata/) for use during the workshops, but aim for participants to be able to reproduce the results on their own data. All the functions defined in notebooks are also available in installable python packages, for use in pipelines.

* [metadata collection](https://github.com/MAMBO-Habitat/metadata/)

## Additions

Planned additions:

* Walkthrough of a simpler, Random Forest based approach to estimating shrub heights given geometries extracted with a deep learning model
