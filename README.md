# Workshops
This repository holds workshop material that covers a machine learning method for analysing drone image data to detect individual Hawthorn shrub clumps.
* Tutorial [notebooks](notebooks) that demo the approaches and reuse the code in other repositories
* Slides [slides](slides)

We [supply data](https://github.com/MAMBO-Habitat/metadata/) for use during the workshops, but aim for participants to be able to reproduce the results on their own data. All the functions defined in notebooks are also available in installable python packages, for use in pipelines.
